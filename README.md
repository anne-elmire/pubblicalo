Imagine instagram for short stories. It's a very simple react app that pulls data from a sample http endpoint and displays short stories on pretty litte post-it notes. Some of the post-its are signed and others are anonymous. The app has an italian name because I was melting in the italian heat when I got started and I couldn't think of a pun in english.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
